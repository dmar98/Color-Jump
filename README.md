## About the Multiplayer Game Mode

In Color Jump, you play in a team of 2, one Red and one Blue character. Characters can only collide with platforms of their color or white platforms. Some platforms change their color to the color of the character that collides with them. The goal of Color Jump is for your team to complete the obstacle course and reach the end platform before any other team. The level features some tricky puzzles that require you and your team mate to carefully think about your moves. Made a wrong move? Jumping out of the play field resets the puzzle for both players. Don't worry, there's a checkpoint after each puzzle that is activated when both players stand on it (it turns green if it's activated).

Happy Jumping!
